            </h3><br>
            A mobile application is required that is capable of<br>a.) Having all the details of the equipment like S/N, Date of Installation etc. by scanning a QR code/ barcode.<br>b.) Readily accessing the past service record by scanning a QR code/ barcode.<br>c.) Entering the details and updating service history on the spot, just after maintenance.

                A cross-platform web app that runs on Android, iOS, Windows and Chrome OS phones as well as any browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scan & generate QR/barcodes with equipment ID & use them to view past service record and details about the equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
                App will also contain a list of jobs that each maintenance personnel has to do within a timeframe and live reporting with feedback to admin/manager is also built into it.

            <li>
                A browser-based dashboard that local admins can use to monitor, update, delete, add data and also visualize projected costs for specific maintenance cases and generate automated reports.

                    Since each airport's inventory infrastructure will be air-gapped for maximum security, the apps we build will work only inside the airport's LAN & WLAN. In order for officials at HQ in New Delhi to be able to tap into each individual airport's database, we route any incoming requests from HQ via a private Nginx reverse-proxy to the requested airport server. All other requests from the outside internet to an airport's server will be blocked by our pfSense<sup>TM</sup> firewall.

                        <li>PHP when used with PDO to make CRUD requests to our database is safer than any other way of accessing a database.</li>

                    Docker will be used to containerize all our backend services on the server. Containers are light and can be deployed in seconds. In case an update has to be made to a single service, all other services can continue to run while only that particular service's docker image is deployed. Upon deployment of the new image, the old image can be killed. This ensures 0 downtime and has your systems up and running 24x7, 365 days a week.
